## About This Project

This interactive web resource documents the devastating financial, human, and infrastructure costs of conflicts in the Horn of Africa region. It presents data on major wars including the Eritrean War of Independence, Ethiopian-Eritrean War, Ogaden War, Ethiopia's interventions in Somalia, and the Tigray War.

## Purpose

This tool counters war rhetoric by clearly demonstrating the immense costs of previous conflicts. By presenting factual, data-driven information about how wars have impacted the Horn of Africa over generations, we hope to:

1. Educate the public about the true costs of regional conflicts
2. Provide a reference for policymakers, journalists, and educators
3. Encourage dialogue focused on peaceful solutions rather than military interventions
4. Document the historical pattern of wars creating regional instability

## Features

- **Interactive data visualization** with charts showing financial, human, and infrastructure costs
- **Timeline view** of major conflicts in the region
- **War cost calculator** demonstrating what could have been built instead (schools, hospitals, etc.)
- **PDF report generator** for offline sharing and distribution
- **Social sharing functionality** to spread awareness
- **Mobile-responsive design** that works on all devices
- **African proverb integration**: "When the elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers"
